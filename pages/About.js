            At Gobind Sarvar, we aim to provide a GurSikhi orientated school,
            within which all the students work hard to realise their full
            blessing of Gurmat (Guru Ji's teachings & values), Gurbani (Guru
            Ji's sacred utterances) and Gurbani Kirtan (the Sikh musical art
            form of singing Gods praises), and provide a caring and loving
            environment to lay the foundations on which the practice of Sikhi is
            fostered and nurtured.

            Gobind Sarvar is a Non-Profit organization run by volunteer members
            who work in partnership to carry out all services of the institute.
            The school's ethos is based on the teachings of Sahib Sri Guru Nanak

            Gobind Sarvar proudly serves as a regional hub for Sikh Education in
            California, drawing its student population from various
            municipalities in the Central Valley, as well as other parts of the
            state. Students attend the institute in addition to attending
            regular K-12 public schools. Thus, students take their
            extracurricular classes at the institute in the evenings and
            weekends.
